# SolderOven
A control board to turn a toaster over and a relay into a solder oven

While this is a public project I am not planning on documenting it until it is somewhat ready.

Consider this to be at the pre-alpha development stage.

##Purpose

The purpose of this board is to act as a solder oven control board.
In addition to providing a user interface it will use a relay to control a toaster oven to provide the functionality of a solder oven.
